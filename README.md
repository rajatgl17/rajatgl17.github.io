I started developing this portfolio website under Freecodecamp's -'Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage'â€‰challenege.

At present this site is not fully completed. I'm trying to make this website's UI similar to Microsoft Windows 1.0 (first GUI OS by Microsoft released in 1985).

For reference I'm using online windows 1.0 emulator - http://www.pcjs.org/devices/pcx86/machine/5160/cga/256kb/win101/
